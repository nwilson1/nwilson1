My name is Noah Wilson, I recently graduated with a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology,
and I previously earned a Master of Science in Physics from the University of Vermont.  I am hoping to begin a career as an engineer.

For the last six years or so I have worked mainly in Python.  I have previous experience with Matlab, and a some exposure to C++, SQL, 
Applescript, Mathematica, and Verilog.  I am mostly self-taught; what skills I have were developed in the process of creating simulations,
statistical analyses, and other miscellaneous projects related to physics and engineering.

I am just starting to build my profile, so there are no projects yet, but I will be building it up over the next few weeks.

The majority, if not the entirety, of my projects to be posted here were done as part of coursework.  Some of them, particularly those I did when 
working toward my MS in Physics, are a few years old and have been recently modified only to add more comments or update them for Python 3.  These 
older codes do not represent my current coding skill or style, but when compared with my more recent work, they give a good idea of my progress in 
the last few years. 

I am always trying to sharpen my skills, become more efficient, and learn new tools.  Feel free to reach out by e-mail or on LinkedIn if you 
would like to chat with me about my work.
